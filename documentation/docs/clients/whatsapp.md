# WhatsApp

> Query your Second Brain from WhatsApp

Text [+1 (848) 800 4242](https://wa.me/18488004242) or scan the QQ code below on your phone to chat with Ridge on WhatsApp.

Without any desktop clients, you can start chatting with Ridge on WhatsApp. Bear in mind you do need one of the desktop clients in order to share and sync your data with Ridge. The WhatsApp AI bot will work right away for answering generic queries and using Ridge in default mode.

In order to use Ridge on WhatsApp with your own data, you need to setup a Ridge Cloud account and connect your WhatsApp account to it. This is a one time setup and you can do it from the [Ridge Cloud config page](https://app.ridge.dev/settings).

If you hit usage limits for the WhatsApp bot, upgrade to [a paid plan](https://ridge.dev/pricing) on Ridge Cloud.

## Features

- **Slash Commands**: Use slash commands to quickly access Ridge features
