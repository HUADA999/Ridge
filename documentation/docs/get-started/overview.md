- It understands pdf, plaintext, markdown, org-mode files, [notion pages](/data-sources/notion_integration) and [github repositories](/data-sources/github_integration)
- Access it from your [Emacs](/clients/emacs), [Obsidian](/clients/obsidian), the [Ridge desktop app](/clients/desktop), or [any web browser](/clients/web)
