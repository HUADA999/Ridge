## Introduction
Welcome to the Ridge Docs! This is the best place to get setup and explore Ridge's features.

- Ridge is an open source, personal AI
- You can [chat](/features/chat) with it about anything. It'll use files you shared with it to respond, when relevant
- Quickly [find](/features/search) relevant notes and documents using natural language
- It understands pdf, plaintext, markdown, org-mode files, [notion pages](/data-sources/notion_integration) and [github repositories](/data-sources/github_integration)
- Access it from your [Emacs](/clients/emacs), [Obsidian](/clients/obsidian), [Web browser](/clients/web) or the [Ridge Desktop app](/clients/desktop)
- Use [cloud](https://app.ridge.dev/login) to access your Ridge anytime from anywhere, [self-host](/get-started/setup) on consumer hardware for privacy
