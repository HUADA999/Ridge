# Image Generation
You can use Ridge to generate images from text prompts. You can get deeper into the  details of our image generation flow in this blog post: https://blog.ridge.dev/posts/how-ridge-generates-images/.

To generate images, you just need to provide a prompt to Ridge in which the image generation is in the instructions. Ridge will automatically detect the image generation intent, augment your generation prompt, and then create the image. Here are some examples:
| Prompt | Image |
| --- | --- |
| Paint a picture of the plants I got last month, pixar-animation | ![plants](/img/plants_i_got.png) |
| Create a picture of my dream house, based on my interests | ![house](/img/dream_house.png) |


## Setup (Self-Hosting)

You have a couple of image generation options.

### OpenAI

1. Get [an OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).
2. Setup your OpenAI API key, if you haven't already. See instructions [here](/get-started/setup#2-configure)
3. Create a text to image config at http://localhost:42110/server/admin/database/texttoimagemodelconfig/. We recommend the `model name` `dall-e-3`. Make sure to associate it with the OpenAI API chat configuration you setup in step 2 with `Openai config` field.

### Flux

1. You need a Replicate API key. You can find one [here](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens).
1. Create a new [Text to Image Model](https://app.ridge.dev/server/admin/database/texttoimagemodelconfig/). Set the `type` to `Replicate`. We recommend the `model name` `black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro`.

### Stable Diffusion

1. Get an API key from [Stable Diffusion](https://www.stablediffusion.com/).
2. Create a new [Text to Image Model](https://app.ridge.dev/server/admin/database/texttoimagemodelconfig/). Set the `type` to `Stabilityai`. We recommend the `model name` `sd3-large`.
