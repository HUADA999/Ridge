# Telemetry

We collect some high level, anonymized metadata about usage of Ridge. This includes:
- Client (Web, Emacs, Obsidian)
- API usage (Search, Chat)
- Configured content types (Github, Org, etc)
- Request metadata (e.g., host, referrer)

We don't send any personal information or any information from/about your content. We only send the above metadata. This helps us prioritize feature development and understand how people are using Ridge. Don't just take our word for it -- you can see [the code here](https://github.com/ridge-ai/ridge/tree/master/src/telemetry).

## Disable Telemetry

You can opt out of telemetry at any time. To do so,
1. Open `~/.ridge/ridge.yml`
2. Set `should-log-telemetry` to `false`
3. Save the file and restart Ridge
