## Introduction
Welcome to the Ridge Docs! This is the best place to get setup and explore Ridge's features.

- Ridge is an open source, personal AI
- You can [chat](chat.md) with it about anything. When relevant, it'll use any notes or documents you shared with it to respond
- Quickly [find](search.md) relevant notes and documents using natural language
- It understands pdf, plaintext, markdown, org-mode files, [notion pages](notion_integration.md) and [github repositories](github_integration.md)
- Access it from your [Emacs](emacs.md), [Obsidian](obsidian.md), [Web browser](web.md) or the [Ridge Desktop app](desktop.md)
- You can self-host Ridge on your consumer hardware or share it with your family, friends or team from your private cloud

## Quickstart
- [Try Ridge Cloud](https://app.ridge.dev) to get started quickly
