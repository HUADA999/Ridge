## Introduction
Welcome to the Ridge Docs! This is the best place to [get started](./setup.md) with Ridge. We have instructions on self-hosting, using Ridge with Emacs, Obsidian, and the Web, and more. We also include setup instructions for users on the hosted instance at [app.ridge.dev](https://app.ridge.dev).

- Ridge is an application to dynamically engage with your notes, documents and images. We support APIs for [semantic search](./search.md) and [chat](./chat.md).
- It can be easily self-hosted and run on your consumer hardware or private cloud.
- It provides an open source, AI personal assistant accessible from your [Emacs](./emacs.md), [Obsidian](./obsidian.md) or [Web browser](./web.md), or our [desktop app](https://ridge.dev/downloads).
- It works with plaintext, markdown, [notion](./notion_integration.md) org-mode, pdf files and [github repositories](./github_integration.md)
- It can support use with multiple users. If you're self-hosting, your family, friends, or team can have a shared assistance server. You'll the the suite of server admin settings at `/server/admin`.
