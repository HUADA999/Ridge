<details><summary>Query Filters</summary>

Use structured query syntax to filter the natural language search results
- **Word Filter**: Get entries that include/exclude a specified term
  - Entries that contain term_to_include: `+"term_to_include"`
  - Entries that contain term_to_exclude: `-"term_to_exclude"`
- **Date Filter**: Get entries containing dates in YYYY-MM-DD format from specified date (range)
  - Entries from April 1st 1984: `dt:"1984-04-01"`
  - Entries after March 31st 1984: `dt>="1984-04-01"`
  - Entries before April 2nd 1984 : `dt<="1984-04-01"`
- **File Filter**: Get entries from a specified file
  - Entries from incoming.org file: `file:"incoming.org"`
- Combined Example
  - `what is the meaning of life? file:"1984.org" dt>="1984-01-01" dt<="1985-01-01" -"big" -"brother"`
  - Adds all filters to the natural language query. It should return entries
    - from the file *1984.org*
    - containing dates from the year *1984*
    - excluding words *"big"* and *"brother"*
    - that best match the natural language query *"what is the meaning of life?"*

### Find Similar Notes
To see other notes similar to the current one, run *Ridge: Find Similar Notes* from the [Command Palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette)

## Upgrade

  pip install --upgrade ridge-assistant
  ```
### 2. Upgrade Plugin
  1. Open *Community plugins* tab in Obsidian settings
  2. Click the *Check for updates* button
  3. Click the *Update* button next to Ridge, if available

## Troubleshooting
  - Open the Ridge plugin settings pane, to configure Ridge
  - Toggle Enable/Disable Ridge, if setting changes have not applied

## Current Limitations
- The plugin loads the index of only one vault at a time.<br/>
  So notes across multiple vaults **cannot** be searched at the same time
