** Interface

** Setup
*** 1. Setup Backend
    #+begin_src shell
      pip install ridge-assistant && ridge
    #+end_src

*** 2. Install Ridge.el
**** Using MELPA
     #+begin_src elisp
      M-x package-install ridge
     #+end_src elisp

     Add below snippet to your Emacs config file
     #+begin_src elisp
     ;; Install Ridge Package from MELPA Stable
     (use-package ridge
        :ensure t
        :pin melpa-stable
        :bind ("C-c s" . 'ridge))
     #+end_src

    Note: Install ~ridge.el~ from MELPA (instead of MELPA Stable) if you installed the pre-release version of ridge
    - That is, use ~:pin melpa~ to install ridge.el in above snippet if ridge was installed with ~pip install --pre ridge-assistant~
    - Else use ~:pin melpa-stable~ to install ridge.el in above snippet if ridge was installed with ~pip install ridge-assistant~
    - This ensures both ridge.el and ridge app are from the same version (tagged or latest)

**** Using [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight.el]]
     Add below snippet to your Emacs config file
     #+begin_src elisp
       ;; Install Ridge Package using Straight.el
       (use-package ridge
         :after org
         :straight (ridge :type git :host github :repo "debanjum/ridge" :files (:defaults "src/interface/emacs/ridge.el"))
         :bind ("C-c s" . 'ridge))
     #+end_src

** Use
   1. Open Query Interface on Client

       - In Emacs: Call ~ridge~ using keybinding ~C-c s~ or ~M-x ridge~
       - On Web: Open http://localhost:8000/

   2. Query Incrementally in Natural Language

      e.g "What is the meaning of life?" "What are my life goals?"

   3. Apply filters to narrow down results further. See [[https://github.com/debanjum/ridge/#query-filters][query filters]] for details

      Include/Exclude specific words or date range from results by updating query with below query format

      e.g `What is the meaning of life? -"god" +"none" dt>"last week"`

** Upgrade
*** Upgrade Ridge Backend
    #+begin_src shell
      pip install --upgrade ridge-assistant
    #+end_src

*** Upgrade Ridge.el
Use your Emacs package manager to upgrade ~ridge.el~

- For ~ridge.el~ from MELPA
  - Method 1
    - Run ~M-x package-list-packages~ to list all packages
    - Press ~U~ on ~ridge~ to mark it for upgrade
    - Press ~x~ to execute the marked actions
  - Method 2
    - Run ~M-x package-refresh-content~
