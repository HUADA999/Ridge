  /The Emacs interface for [[https://github.com/debanjum/ridge][Ridge]]/

** Prerequisites
   - Install and Run [[https://github.com/debanjum/ridge][Ridge]]

** Installation
**** Using MELPA
     #+begin_src elisp
      M-x package-install ridge
     #+end_src elisp

     Add below snippet to your Emacs config file
     #+begin_src elisp
     ;; Install Ridge Package from MELPA Stable
     (use-package ridge
        :ensure t
        :pin melpa-stable
        :bind ("C-c s" . 'ridge))
     #+end_src

    Note: Install ~ridge.el~ from MELPA (instead of MELPA Stable) if you installed the pre-release version of ridge
    - That is, use ~:pin melpa~ to install ridge.el in above snippet if ridge was installed with ~pip install --pre ridge-assistant~
    - Else use ~:pin melpa-stable~ to install ridge.el in above snippet if ridge was installed with ~pip install ridge-assistant~
    - This ensures both ridge.el and ridge app are from the same version (tagged or latest)

**** Using [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight.el]]
     Add below snippet to your Emacs config file
     #+begin_src elisp
       ;; Install Ridge Package using Straight.el
       (use-package ridge
         :after org
         :straight (ridge :type git :host github :repo "debanjum/ridge" :files (:defaults "src/interface/emacs/ridge.el"))
         :bind ("C-c s" . 'ridge))
     #+end_src

** Usage
   1. Open Query Interface on Client

       - In Emacs: Call ~ridge~ using keybinding ~C-c s~ or ~M-x ridge~
       - On Web: Open http://localhost:8000/

   2. Query Incrementally in Natural Language

      e.g "What is the meaning of life?" "What are my life goals?"

   3. Apply filters to narrow down results further

      Include/Exclude specific words or date range from results by updating query with below query format

      e.g `What is the meaning of life? -god +none dt:"last week"`
